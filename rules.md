# Rules of the 100 Days Of Code Challenge

## Main Commitment
### *I will try to code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days, not including days i can't like holidays.*

#### Start Date
Sept 12th, 2021. 

## Additional Rules
1. If I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge.
2. I will push code to my repo every day. 
3. I will update the (Log)[log.md] with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
