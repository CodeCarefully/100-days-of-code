# I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge

I'm not playing entirely fair though.

I got rid of a LOT of what I consider the "cruft" of the original challenge, which you can clone at [https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code](https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code) and check out for yourself.

They have a slack and everything.

I'm mostly using this as a way to encourage myself to make progress, but I'm definitely no longer at the stage in my life that I'm willing to sacrifice things that are important to me in order to code in my free time just because a challenge told me to.

Additionally, I'm very conflicted with doing this at GitHub at all due to the whole [ICE thing](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/01/ice-contract-github-sparks-developer-protests/604339/)
Do better GitHub.
