### Day 1: Sept 13, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: 

Built the basic version of [pyCovidCLI](https://github.com/CodeCarefully/pyCovidCLI). 
I did it late yesterday and a bit today, so no idea where to log this.

I also forgot to log hours

**Thoughts:** 

The app is super rough and its weird to me to think of "sharing it".

**Tool of the day:**

Notepad++ has an excellent markdown viewer with a spellcheck and a previewer. What more could someone ask for?

### Day 2: Sept 14, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: 

Did more work on [pyCovidCLI](https://github.com/CodeCarefully/pyCovidCLI). 
This time I added docopt for command line options and documentation

**Thoughts:** 

it looks a bit better, but the file is a bit cluttered. Also COVID sucks.

### Day 4: Sept 16, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: 

Did some poking around with GUI toolkit code.
Since its 3am and I really don't have the energy to make anything clean to upload, you'll have to trust me.

**Thoughts:** 

* GUI in python is annoying. 
* WX Widgets seems to be the best option if you want cross-platform and free.

### Day 5: Sept 17, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: 

Made a bunch of repos for the other projects I'm working on.
Started Speccing out the wedding one, again.

**Thoughts:** 

The wedding project is surprisingly difficult without a specific customer I'm building for.
