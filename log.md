### Day 1: Sept 13, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: 

Built the basic version of [pyCovidCLI](https://github.com/CodeCarefully/pyCovidCLI). 
I did it late yesterday and a bit today, so no idea where to log this.

I also forgot to log hours

**Thoughts:** 

The app is super rough and its weird to me to think of "sharing it".

**Tool of the day:**

Notepad++ has an excellent markdown viewer with a spellcheck and a previewer. What more could someone ask for?

### Day 2: Sept 14, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: 

Did more work on [pyCovidCLI](https://github.com/CodeCarefully/pyCovidCLI). 
This time I added docopt for command line options and documentation

**Thoughts:** 

it looks a bit better, but the file is a bit cluttered. Also COVID sucks.

### Day 4: Sept 16, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: 

Did some poking around with GUI toolkit code.
Since its 3am and I really don't have the energy to make anything clean to upload, you'll have to trust me.

**Thoughts:** 

* GUI in python is annoying. 
* WX Widgets seems to be the best option if you want cross-platform and free.

### Day 5: Sept 17, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: 

Made a bunch of repos for the other projects I'm working on.
Started Speccing out the wedding one, again.

**Thoughts:** 

The wedding project is surprisingly difficult without a specific customer I'm building for.

### Day 8: Sept 20, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: 

Made shiny readme file with badges for [DjangoWedding](https://github.com/CodeCarefully/DjangoWedding).

**Thoughts:** 

One of the nice things about writing docs and readmes before the actual project is that it forces you to flesh out the ideas more.
I like the thought of approaching the wedding project as a lot more than an RSVP system, but as a sort of "Wedding manager"

### Day 9: Sept 21, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: 

Did the initial commit of my RSS-To-IRC  [RSS-To-IRC](https://github.com/CodeCarefully/RSS-To-IRC) app.
It's being used right now to provide security news updates to some IRC channels I run.

Also added shields to the Readme of a project I did a commit on earlier. I'm betting it won't be merged.

**Thoughts:** 

Tutorials rock.

### Day 10: Sept 22, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: 

Renamed DjangoWedding to WeddingBliss 
I decided to do it form scratch, rather than use the cookiecutter template I was working from originally.

I built the repo, and filled out all the initial documentation files.
