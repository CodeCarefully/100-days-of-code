### Day 1: Sept 13, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: 

Built the basic version of [pyCovidCLI](https://github.com/CodeCarefully/pyCovidCLI). 
I did it late yesterday and a bit today, so no idea where to log this.

I also forgot to log hours

**Thoughts:** 

The app is super rough and its weird to me to think of "sharing it".

**Tool of the day:**

Notepad++ has an excellent markdown viewer with a spellcheck and a previewer. What more could someone ask for?

___

### Day 2: Sept 14, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: 

Did more work on [pyCovidCLI](https://github.com/CodeCarefully/pyCovidCLI). 
This time I added docopt for command line options and documentation

**Thoughts:** 

it looks a bit better, but the file is a bit cluttered. Also COVID sucks.

### Day 4: Sept 16, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: 

Did some poking around with GUI toolkit code.
Since its 3am and I really don't have the energy to make anything clean to upload, you'll have to trust me.

**Thoughts:** 

* GUI in python is annoying. 
* WX Widgets seems to be the best option if you want cross-platform and free.

### Day 5: Sept 17, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: 

Made a bunch of repos for the other projects I'm working on.
Started Speccing out the wedding one, again.

**Thoughts:** 

The wedding project is surprisingly difficult without a specific customer I'm building for.

### Day 6: Sept 18, 2021 

**Today's Progress**:

### Day 8: Sept 20, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: 

Made shiny readme file with badges for [DjangoWedding](https://github.com/CodeCarefully/DjangoWedding).

**Thoughts:** 

One of the nice things about writing docs and readmes before the actual project is that it forces you to flesh out the ideas more.
I like the thought of approaching the wedding project as a lot more than an RSVP system, but as a sort of "Wedding manager"

### Day 9: Sept 21, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: 

Did the initial commit of my RSS-To-IRC  [RSS-To-IRC](https://github.com/CodeCarefully/RSS-To-IRC) app.
It's being used right now to provide security news updates to some IRC channels I run.

Also added shields to the Readme of a project I did a commit on earlier. I'm betting it won't be merged.

**Thoughts:** 

Tutorials rock.

### Day 10: Sept 22, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: 

Renamed DjangoWedding to WeddingBliss 
I decided to do it form scratch, rather than use the cookiecutter template I was working from originally.

I built the repo, and filled out all the initial documentation files.

**Today's Progress**:

### Day 15: Sept 27, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: 

Added static files. I had some weird issues with Django seemingly inexplicably only losing files from STATICFILES_DIRS,
and yet not allowing the root static dir to be in them.

**Thoughts:** 

I need the templating system to be more dynamic, and I need some proper graphical assets that are "open source" for the default template
Ideally setting the "template" field in the wedding would determine what page to load.

but how would the system know?

maybe a master index page of wedding choosers, assuming the domain isn't listed in the system.

so the plan would be to associate a wedding to a domain name.

### Day 23: Oct 5, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: 

Made an exe for the Django version of the chargen program, and I'm officially badass, because this was crazy.

You can see it [here](https://github.com/CodeCarefully/Character_Generator/releases/download/0.1.0/RunLocalDjangoCharGen.exe) 
if you are a fan of janky self extractors.

This was a massive multi-step process (which is quick now that I know how, but was hard to figure out) which involved:

1) Using Pyinstaller to generate the initial exe
2) Discovering the templates were missing and copying them in
3) Writing a BAT file to run the Django server, and open the browser
4) Zipping it all together
5) using mt.exe to make a version of the 7-zip SFX addon that won't ask for Administrator access
6) building the EXE
7) making a GitHub release
8) ....party?

### Day 24: Oct 10, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: 

so its been a few days - I've made SOME progress daily but its been hard to have something whole enough to commit.
I managed to get invites working (validating on the code and stuff), the wedding chooser and cleaned stuff up and thought out the RSVP system

### Day 25: Dec 12, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: 

Trying to get back in the saddle of this. Did some working on class-based freeform POST form processing
that was difficult to get good information on. 


**Thoughts:** 

Maybe I'm biased, seeing as I'm coming back to this after a significant break and my mind isn't in gear as much with Django, 
but finding documentation on how to do something as "simple" as process my own form took a long time, considering how simple it should be/is.
When I finally figured it out, it was a very "I'm an idiot, that was easy" moment though.
