### Day 1: Sept 13, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: 

Built the basic version of [pyCovidCLI](https://github.com/CodeCarefully/pyCovidCLI). 
I did it late yesterday and a bit today, so no idea where to log this.

I also forgot to log hours

**Thoughts:** 

The app is super rough and its weird to me to think of "sharing it".

**Tool of the day:**

Notepad++ has an excellent markdown viewer with a spellcheck and a previewer. What more could someone ask for?

### Day 2: Sept 14, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: 

Did more work on [pyCovidCLI](https://github.com/CodeCarefully/pyCovidCLI). 
This time I added docopt for command line options and documentation

**Thoughts:** 

it looks a bit better, but the file is a bit cluttered. Also COVID sucks.

### Day 4: Sept 16, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: 

Did some poking around with GUI toolkit code.
Since its 3am and I really don't have the energy to make anything clean to upload, you'll have to trust me.

**Thoughts:** 

* GUI in python is annoying. 
* WX Widgets seems to be the best option if you want cross-platform and free.

### Day 5: Sept 17, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: 

Made a bunch of repos for the other projects I'm working on.
Started Speccing out the wedding one, again.

**Thoughts:** 

The wedding project is surprisingly difficult without a specific customer I'm building for.

### Day 8: Sept 20, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: 

Made shiny readme file with badges for [DjangoWedding](https://github.com/CodeCarefully/DjangoWedding).

**Thoughts:** 

One of the nice things about writing docs and readmes before the actual project is that it forces you to flesh out the ideas more.
I like the thought of approaching the wedding project as a lot more than an RSVP system, but as a sort of "Wedding manager"

### Day 9: Sept 21, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: 

Did the initial commit of my RSS-To-IRC  [RSS-To-IRC](https://github.com/CodeCarefully/RSS-To-IRC) app.
It's being used right now to provide security news updates to some IRC channels I run.

Also added shields to the Readme of a project I did a commit on earlier. I'm betting it won't be merged.

**Thoughts:** 

Tutorials rock.

### Day 10: Sept 22, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: 

Renamed DjangoWedding to WeddingBliss 
I decided to do it form scratch, rather than use the cookiecutter template I was working from originally.

I built the repo, and filled out all the initial documentation files.

### Day 15: Sept 27, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: 

Added static files. I had some weird issues with Django seemingly inexplicably only losing files from STATICFILES_DIRS,
and yet not allowing the root static dir to be in them.

**Thoughts:** 

I need the templating system to be more dynamic, and I need some proper graphical assets that are "open source" for the default template
Ideally setting the "template" field in the wedding would determine what page to load.

but how would the system know?

maybe a master index page of wedding choosers, assuming the domain isn't listed in the system.

so the plan would be to associate a wedding to a domain name.
